## Theses

* The strongest right a parliament has is budget law - for that taxes are compulsory.
* There is a growing demand for civic participation.
* There is dolefulness with politics, political processes and the political personell.
* Plebiscites are a complex instrument.
* Bundling and balance of interests by political parties and the parliament are necessary and have to be kept - amongst others due to efficiency aspects.

## Solution

digitaletat - as a ring-fenced tax - is an efficient instrument to achieve direct democracy:

* Every citizen (natural person) is allowed to distribute 2% of his or her overall yearly tax payments to a pre-defined set of buckets (those being on a high level of abstraction).
* This will be only practical by utilizing modern and secure information technology.
* It will be critical, that those buckets are sufficiently abstract and not too many - and that they stay like that over time.
* Examples of possible structures of those buckets (increasing complexity):
  * The n governmental departments - citizens will directly influence the budget of ministries.
  * A set of topics discussed by parliament.
  * A set of longterm projects discussed by parliament.
  * A set of community driven topics and projects.
   
## Conclusion

digitaletat makes a 'smooth' but yet striking form of direct demoracy possible - without limiting governmental capacity to act (in edge case).

digitaletat is Civic participation 4.0.

digitaletat is not comparable to more local or municipal approchaes (e.g. Or√ßamento participativo (Wikipedia)), as it explicitely targets 'big' topics on national or even supranationel level.
